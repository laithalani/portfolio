            I love to learn new techs and expand my knowledge. I have done a few web development and there are a lot of parts to it. The part that I love is that I can build something and I can see it immediately. I can show it to people and they can interact with it. 
            </p>

                Many people love being web developer because they can extend their creativity and passion on developing websites, and Iâ€™m one of them.
